.SS Job Related Options

.TP
.BR \-\^\-job-id =\fIID\fP
The job ID of the job to handle or view.

.TP
.BR \-\^\-log\-format [ =\fIFORMATSTRING\fP "]
The string that controls the format of the printed log and job messages. The
format string uses the '%' character to mark variable fields, flag characters as
they are specified in the standard printf() C library functions and its own
field name letters to refer to the various properties of the messages. 

The "%+12I" format string for example has the "+12" flag characters in it with
the standard meaning: the field will be 12 character wide and the "+" or "-"
sign will always be printed with the number.

Standard '\\' notation is also available, \\n for example encodes a new-line 
character.

The properties of the message are encoded by letters. The in the "%-5L" for
example the letter "L" encodes the "line-number" field, so the number of the
source line that produced the message will be substituted. The program supports
the following fields:

.RS 7
.TP
.B B
The base name of the source file that produced the message. 

.TP
.B C
The creation date&time that marks the exact moment when the message was
created. The format of the date&time sustituted can be set using the 
\fB\-\^\-date\-format\fP command line option.

.TP
.B F
The name of the source file that created the message. This is similar to the
\fBB\fR fields, but instead of the base name the entire file name will be
substituted.

.TP
.B I
The ID of the message, a numerical ID that can be used as a unique identifier
for the message.

.TP
.B J
The Job ID.

.TP
.B L
The line number in the source file where the message was created. This property
is implemented mostly for debugging purposes.

.TP
.B M
The message text.

.TP
.B S 
The severity of the message in text format. This field can be "MESSAGE",
"WARNING" or "FAILURE".

.TP
.B T
The creation time of the message. This is similar to the \fBC\fR field, but
shows only hours, minutes and seconds instead of the full date and time.

.TP
.B %
The '%' character itself. 

.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The s9s application will read and consider the following environment variables:
.TP 5 
CMON_CONTROLLER

contacted. This also can be set using the \fB\-\-controller\fR command line
option.

.TP 5
CMON_CLUSTER_ID
The numerical ID of the cluster to control, same as the \fB\-\-cluster\-id\fR
command line option.
